# UA Libraries TeSS Cheatsheets

Cheatsheets for the University of Arizona Libraries TeSS

## Getting started

The documentation pages are generated on the fly in the browser using [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org).
There aren't any dependencies to install. Simply add markdown files to the `docs` directory and push to master to deploy.
Documentation is written using [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
